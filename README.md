## Description:
Riddler is a web application that allows users to solve riddles randomly or categorically. The technology stack used to build this application is Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Mongoose, and React.js. (MERN Stack). It is hosted on Heroku. The project duration was 8 hours.


## Motivation:
The motivation behind this project was that my landlord's kids wanted me to ask them riddles and I was running out of it more than I could think of. So I decided to create a web application that would allow me to ask them riddles and also allow them to solve it.
They loved it. I hope you do too.
